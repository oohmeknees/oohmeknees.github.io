  <h1>What's Mavis' password?</h1>
  <p>Mavis has an online bank account that is protected by a password<br>

    <li>Her birth date is 15/01/1932</li>
    <li>She has grandchildren Alexander, Elisabeth, Jackson</li>
    <li>She has a cat called Alfie</li>
    <li>She lives in Australia</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What could her password be? Try and crack it online</p>
  <p>Type in password below:</p>
